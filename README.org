All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system with me.

** Shell support

These dotfiles are meant to be used with Bash 4+. Also, your shell should
support colors so everything works well. These dotfiles aren't for Zsh, but
some scripts may work as Zsh accepts Bash interpreter.

** Links

Other projects I also support are:

- [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/.emacs.d][My Emacs configuration]]
  My personal configuration for GNU Emacs which I port around from
  system to system with me.
