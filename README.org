All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system. The goal of this
project is to organize my shell scripts and configurations, and to keep
them synchronized across multiple machines. It started as a basic setup,
but now it includes management of =.bashrc=, =.profile=, and various other
shell-related files and tools.

This repository supports both Linux and macOS, with a focus on keeping the
configurations portable and adaptable to different environments.

** Shell support

These dotfiles are primarily designed for Bash, but many scripts and
configurations are compatible with Zsh and other Bash-like shells. The
shell should support colors and basic POSIX features for optimal behavior.
