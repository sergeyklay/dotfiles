All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system with me.

** Shell support

These dotfiles are meant to be used with Bash >= 5.x, but some scripts may
work as Zsh accepts Bash interpreter.  Also, your shell should support colors
so everything works well.  Wherever possible, compatibility with Linux as well
as macOS is maintained.

** Links

Other projects I also support from time to time are:
