* =~/.*=

All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system. The goal of this
project is to organize my shell scripts and configurations, and to keep
them synchronized across multiple machines. It started as a basic setup,
but now it includes management of =.bashrc=, =.bash_profile=, and various other
shell-related files and tools.

** Supported OS

This repository is primarily intended for Linux workstations, though
some configuration files and scripts are also compatible with
macOS. Below is a list of the main Linux distributions where these
dotfiles will be relevant and functional:

- Gentoo Linux (recommend)
- Arch Linux
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Fedora

** Shell support

These dotfiles are primarily designed for Bash, but many scripts and
configurations are compatible with Zsh and other Bash-like shells. The
shell should support colors and basic POSIX features for optimal behavior.

** Components

This repository is primarily a project where I store my personal
configuration files. Some aspects may seem unusual to you, but
ultimately, this is my setup to which I’m accustomed. It’s worth
noting that I use Gentoo Linux as my main system and GNU Emacs as my
primary text editor, so this configuration is built around that
fact. Below are links to the projects that I also maintain:

- [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/.emacs.d][GNU Emacs configuration]]: My personal configuration for GNU Emacs
- [[https://github.com/sergeyklay/lenovo-legion-y520-15ikbn][Lenovo Y520 Setup]]: Gentoo configuration for Lenovo Y520 (Legion)

** Install

Many similar projects offer complex (in my humble opinion) systems for
installing and bootstrapping configuration files. I find this to be an
unnecessary complication that doesn’t add transparency and forces
users to carefully review the installation scripts before running
them. Finally, this would place an additional burden on me to maintain
these scripts, including all the corner cases, which I consider an
excessive price to pay. To utilize my configuration files, simply
clone the repository and create symbolic links for what you need. I’ve
been doing this for 11 years and plan to continue for the next 11.
