# The IMAP protocol keeps an "internaldate" for each message, which represents
# the date and time when the email was first received by the server. This is
# different from the date in the email's header, which is set by the sender.
# Some email clients and web interfaces, like Fastmail, use this internaldate
# to sort messages chronologically.
#
# By enabling the "CopyArrivalDate" option, mbsync will use the file's
# modification date from the local Maildir as the IMAP internaldate, and
# vice versa. This ensures that emails keep their correct received time when
# syncing, rather than using the time of synchronization. Without this option,
# the sync time might be used as the internaldate, causing emails to appear
# out of order in clients that rely on the internaldate for sorting.
