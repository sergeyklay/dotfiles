# Initialize NVM (Node Version Manager).
#
# Formed as a function to optimize shell startup time by avoiding
# unnecessary searches for the NVM installation and sourcing nvm.sh
# during every shell session.  Instead, users can call `nvm-init` only
# when they need to work with Node.js.
#
# Usage:
#   $ source "$(command -v nvm-init)"

    if [ -r "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ]; then

      unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
