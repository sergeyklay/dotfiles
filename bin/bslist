# This script mimics the legacy `launchctl bslist` command, which is
# no longer available.  It uses `launchctl print` to extract and
# display a list of active or on-demand services registered with the
# system's bootstrap server.
#
# Operation:
#
# - If the script is run as root, it targets the system-wide domain.
# - If run as a non-privileged user, it targets the per-user domain.
# - The output is filtered to only show relevant service information in a concise format.
#
# Usage:
#
#   $ bslist
#
# Example Output:
# A  com.apple.dock.server
# D  com.apple.udb.system-push

if [ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]; then
