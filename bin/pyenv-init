# Initialize pyenv (Python Env).
#
# Formed as a function to optimize shell startup time by avoiding
# unnecessary evaling "pyenv init -" during every shell session.
# Instead, users can call `pyenv-init` only when they need to work with
# Python.
#
# Usage:
#   pyenv-init

# Check if PYENV_SHELL is not set
if [ -z "${PYENV_SHELL+x}" ]; then
  # Check if the pyenv command exists
  if command -v pyenv >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"

    # Check if pyenv has the virtualenv-init command
    if pyenv commands | grep -q virtualenv-init; then
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    fi

    # Disable the virtualenv prompt
    PYENV_VIRTUALENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1
    export PYENV_VIRTUALENV_DISABLE_PROMPT
  fi

# Local Variables:
