# Initialize rbenv (Ruby Env).
#
# Formed as a function to optimize shell startup time by avoiding
# unnecessary evaling "rbenv init -" during every shell session.
# Instead, users can call `rbenv-init` only when they need to work with
# Ruby.
#
# Usage:
#   $ source "$(command -v rbenv-init)"

if [[ -z "${RBENV_SHELL+x}" ]]; then
  if command -v rbenv >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval "$(rbenv init -)"
