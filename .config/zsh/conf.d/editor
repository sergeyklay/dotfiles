# This file contains the definition of the editor.
#
# EDITOR             Terminal editor (GNU Emacs).  Should be able to
#                    work without use of "advanced" terminal
#                    functionality.
# VISUAL             A GUI editor could be a full screen editor.
# ALTERNATE_EDITOR   Editor to fallback to if the server is not
#                    running.
#
# To see GNU Emacs configuration I use refer to:
# https://github.com/sergeyklay/.emacs.d
#
# To run GNU Emacs in server mode see:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html

# -F will exit less if the output fits on one screen (so you don't
#    have to press "q").
