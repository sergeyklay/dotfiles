# The file containing the default shell options for all shells
#
# The main purpose of this file is to set options that influence the
# shell's behaviour in scripts.

# If a word begins with an unquoted '=' and the EQUALS option is
# set, the remainder of the word is taken as the name of a command.
#
#   $ (setopt equals; echo =make)
#   /usr/bin/make
#
#   $ (setopt noequals; echo =make)
#   =make

# For more see: man 1 zshexpn
setopt equals

# Allows '>' redirection to truncate existing files.
# For more see: man 1 zshoptions

# This will enable a separated context for options in functions.
