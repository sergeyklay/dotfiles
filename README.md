# `~/.*`

All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system with me.

## Shell support

These dotfiles are meant to be used with Bash 4+. Also, your shell should
support colors so everything works well. These dotfiles aren't for Zsh, but
some scripts may work as Zsh accepts Bash interpreter.

## Links

Other projects I also support from time to time are:

- [GNU Emacs configuration][1]
  My personal configuration for GNU Emacs which I port around from
  system to system with me.

- [Vim configuration][2]
  My personal configuration for Vim which I port around from
  system to system with me.
