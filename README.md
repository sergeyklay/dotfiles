# `~/.*`

All my dotfiles that I port around from system to system with me.

## Shell support

These dotfiles are meant to be used with zsh.  Also, your shell should support
colors so everything works well.

## Links

Other projects I also support from time to time are:

- [GNU Emacs configuration][emacs.d] My personal configuration for GNU Emacs
