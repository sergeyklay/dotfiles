## Shell support

These dotfiles are meant to be used with Bash 4+. Also, your shell should
support colors so everything works well. These dotfiles aren't for Zsh, but
some scripts may work as Zsh accepts Bash interpreter.

## Links

Other projects I also support are:

- [spacemacs-config](https://github.com/sergeyklay/spacemacs-config) -
  Personal config file, private layer, notes and any other resources
  for the [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org/)
